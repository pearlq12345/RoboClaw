# RoboClaw Installation Guide

This guide is the native host installation path. If you want Docker-based workflows, use:

- [Docker Installation](./DOCKERINSTALLATION.md)

## 1. Prerequisites

Start from a clean clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MINT-SJTU/RoboClaw.git
cd RoboClaw
```

## 2. Step 1: Install RoboClaw

Install the package in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

After installation, the `roboclaw` command should be available:

```bash
roboclaw --help
```

Expected result:

- commands such as `onboard`, `status`, `agent`, and `provider` are listed

For SO101 embodied control, make sure calibration data is available under
`~/.roboclaw/calibration/so101/`. The RoboClaw install now includes the Python
`scservo_sdk` dependency bundle directly, so native users should get the same
driver module that Docker uses. If you still have an older compatible
calibration cache on the host, the first real SO101 control run will import it
into `~/.roboclaw/calibration/so101/`.

## 3. Step 2: Initialize RoboClaw

Run:

```bash
roboclaw onboard
```

This should create `~/.roboclaw/config.json`, `~/.roboclaw/workspace/`, and the initial embodied workspace scaffold. You can verify it with:

```bash
find ~/.roboclaw -maxdepth 4 -type f | sort
```

You should see at least:

```text
~/.roboclaw/config.json
~/.roboclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md
~/.roboclaw/workspace/EMBODIED.md
~/.roboclaw/workspace/HEARTBEAT.md
~/.roboclaw/workspace/SOUL.md
~/.roboclaw/workspace/TOOLS.md
~/.roboclaw/workspace/USER.md
~/.roboclaw/workspace/memory/HISTORY.md
~/.roboclaw/workspace/memory/MEMORY.md
~/.roboclaw/workspace/embodied/README.md
~/.roboclaw/workspace/embodied/intake/README.md
~/.roboclaw/workspace/embodied/robots/README.md
~/.roboclaw/workspace/embodied/sensors/README.md
```

## 4. Step 3: Verify Status Output

Run:

```bash
roboclaw status
```

Check that:

- `Config` is shown as `✓`
- `Workspace` is shown as `✓`
- the current `Model` looks correct
- provider status matches the actual state of your machine

## 5. Step 4: Configure the Model Provider

Before testing `roboclaw agent`, make sure the model provider is configured.

First run:

```bash
roboclaw status
```

This tells you which providers are already available on the current machine.

Two common cases:

### 5.1 OAuth provider

If you are using an OAuth-based provider, log in directly.

The current codebase supports:

```bash
roboclaw provider login openai-codex
roboclaw provider login github-copilot
```

### 5.2 API key provider

If you are using an API-key-based provider, edit:

```bash
~/.roboclaw/config.json
```

Fill in the provider key and default model there.

Common API key providers include:

- `openai`
- `anthropic`
- `openrouter`
- `deepseek`
- `gemini`
- `zhipu`
- `dashscope`
- `moonshot`
- `minimax`
- `aihubmix`
- `siliconflow`
- `volcengine`
- `azureOpenai`
- `custom`
- `vllm`

Then run:

```bash
roboclaw status
```

Check that:

- the current `Model` is correct
- the provider you want to use is no longer `not set`

## 6. Step 5: Verify the Basic Model Path

Run one minimal message to confirm that RoboClaw can respond:

```bash
roboclaw agent -m "hello"
```

Check that:

- the agent starts successfully
- the agent returns a normal reply
- failures point clearly to model configuration, provider setup, network, or permissions

## 7. Step 6: Let RoboClaw Start the Robot Setup Flow

Once the basic conversation path works, start the embodied setup flow.

Describe your goal in natural language.

For a real robot:

```bash
roboclaw agent -m "I want to connect a real robot. Please guide me step by step."
```

If you already know it is an arm:

```bash
roboclaw agent -m "I want to connect a real robot arm. Tell me what information you need and guide me step by step."
```

For a simulator:

```bash
roboclaw agent -m "I want to connect a robot simulation environment. Please guide me step by step."
```

At this step, check that:

- RoboClaw understands that this is a first-run robot setup flow
- RoboClaw asks for missing facts instead of assuming them
- RoboClaw asks questions in a way that a normal user can follow
- RoboClaw does not require the user to understand the internal code structure first

If RoboClaw starts guiding you through device information, connection details, sensors, or runtime environment, the embodied entry path is working.

After continuing the conversation, you can check:

```bash
find ~/.roboclaw/workspace/embodied -maxdepth 3 -type f | sort
git status --short
```

Check that:

- new files start appearing under `~/.roboclaw/workspace/embodied/`
- RoboClaw does not write setup-specific content back into the framework source tree

The ideal outcome is:

- the user only describes the goal
- RoboClaw keeps the framework/workspace boundary intact

## 8. Native Acceptance Helpers

For a bounded native SO101 acceptance run on the host, use:

```bash
./tests/test_native_so101_acceptance.sh
```

If calibration is missing, RoboClaw now reports the canonical path expected by
the active profile and blocks execution until that framework-managed calibration
exists.

That helper prepares canonical calibration under `~/.roboclaw/calibration/so101/`,
checks `roboclaw agent -m "hello"`, and then runs the real-robot flow:

- `I want to connect a real robot`
- `SO101`
- `connected`
- `open the gripper`
- `close the gripper`

## 9. Step 7: Verify That Embodied Assets Are Organized Correctly

You do not need every asset to be complete in one pass, but you should verify that the directory semantics are correct.

Pay attention to these paths:

```text
~/.roboclaw/workspace/embodied/intake/
~/.roboclaw/workspace/embodied/robots/
~/.roboclaw/workspace/embodied/sensors/
~/.roboclaw/workspace/embodied/assemblies/
~/.roboclaw/workspace/embodied/deployments/
~/.roboclaw/workspace/embodied/adapters/
~/.roboclaw/workspace/embodied/simulators/
```

Check that:

- intake facts land in `intake/` first
- robot, sensor, and setup assets are written into the right semantic directories
- the resulting layout is understandable and maintainable

The goal here is not to prove that every asset is perfect. The goal is to verify that the path is structured well enough to extend.

## 9. Step 8: If You Have a Real Robot or Simulator, Test the Embodied Flow

Only continue with this section if you actually have a real embodiment or simulator available.

If RoboClaw detects that ROS2 is not installed, do not let it improvise an installation guide. It should read and follow:

```text
roboclaw/templates/embodied/guides/ROS2_INSTALL.md
```

The goal is to:

- prefer a supported platform-specific installation path
- prefer Ubuntu binary installation before source builds
- record the ROS2 result and distro into intake or workspace assets
- continue to deployment and adapter generation only after ROS2 is ready

This is where the core first-plane goal starts to matter:

- connect
- calibrate
- move
- debug
- reset
