## 📢 News

- **2026-03-24** Conversational arm setup, calibration, teleoperation, data collection, training, and inference.
- **2026-03-17** Embodied framework skeleton, domain contracts, and assembly-centered onboarding controller.
- **2026-03-12** Repository created.

## 📦 Installation

- `Preferred local workflow`:

```bash
uv venv
uv sync --extra dev
uv run roboclaw onboard
```

- `Embodied learning stack`:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev --extra learning
```

- `AI-assisted setup`: ask your coding assistant:

```text
Help me install RoboClaw from https://github.com/MINT-SJTU/RoboClaw
```

- [Non-Docker Installation](./docs/INSTALLATION.md)
- [Docker Installation](./docs/DOCKERINSTALLATION.md)

## 📢 Community Co-Creation

RoboClaw is being built in the open. We want major direction-setting choices, such as embodiment support, simulator priorities, and roadmap focus, to be discussed with the community.

You can contribute through:

- `Issues`: bug reports, feature requests, and implementation suggestions
- `Pull Requests`: code and documentation improvements

The most useful contribution areas right now are:

- embodied AI architecture
- capability abstraction and semantic skill interfaces
- ROS2 and execution-layer integration
- simulator support and real robot adaptation
- evaluation, validation, and developer experience

If you want to contribute more actively, contact us at bozhaonanjing [[@]] gmail [[DOT]] com.


## 🙏 Acknowledgments

RoboClaw references and inherits part of its initial thinking from [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot). We appreciate its lightweight practice along the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) line, which helped us build the first prototype faster and continue evolving toward embodied intelligence.
